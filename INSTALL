To install the module, first go to the directory "extensions/cython".

Edit the Makefile. Set the variable in the uppermost line to the location of
the pCore library, for example:

PDYNAMO_PCORE = /home/mikolaj/local/opt/pDynamo-1.8.0/pCore-1.8.0

In the next step, run "make" followed by "make install". 

If you wish to redo the buildinig process, run "make clean" first and 
then "make" again. The command "make clean_all" will also clean up the Cython
sources.

After the installation, extend your PYTHONPATH variable with the directory 
containing the new module, for example add to ~/.bashrc the following two lines:

export PDYNAMO_XTCTRAJECTORY=/home/mikolaj/devel/XTCTrajectory

export PYTHONPATH=$PDYNAMO_ROOT/pBabel-$PDYNAMO_VERSION:$PDYNAMO_ROOT/pCore-$PDYNAMO_VERSION:$PDYNAMO_ROOT/pMolecule-$PDYNAMO_VERSION:$PDYNAMO_ROOT/pMoleculeScripts-$PDYNAMO_VERSION:$PDYNAMO_XTCTRAJECTORY
